        <h3>Meet Goldy</h3>
        <p>
          My favorite pet is different from that of my friends. On my seventh
          birthday, my father bought me a little goldfish. We kept it in a glass
          bowl on my table. Since then it has been my best friend. I call my
          fish Goldie. It is very beautiful. It has a golden tail and lovely
          fins. Its big black eyes are a treat to look at. It swims in the bowl
          like a mermaid.I share all my secrets with my goldfish. I make sure
          that I feed it on time. When I go to school, my mother looks after it.
          I miss it a lot when I am not at home. All my friends love it too. I
          wish I could play with it more often and take it along with me
          wherever I go. But I cannot take it out of the water.
