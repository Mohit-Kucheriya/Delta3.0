# Web Development Course - Delta 3.0 (Apna College)

This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey through the **Delta 3.0 Web Development Course** by **Apna College**. The course covers a comprehensive range of web development topics, from **HTML** and **CSS** to advanced **JavaScript** concepts, **Node.js**, and **React**.

Inside this repository, you'll find structured notes, code samples, and project files as I work through each module of the course. The goal is to provide a clear, organized reference for both current and future use, reflecting everything I've learned about:

- Building websites using **HTML** and **CSS**.
- Responsive design, media queries, and CSS frameworks like **Bootstrap** and **Tailwind CSS**.
- Frontend functionality with **JavaScript**, including DOM manipulation, closures, and async programming.
- Working with **Node.js** for backend development and integrating databases like **MongoDB**.
- Developing full-stack projects using **React**, hooks, Redux, and more.

Follow along as I delve deeper into the world of web development through Delta 3.0!
